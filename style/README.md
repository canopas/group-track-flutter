fonts, themes, and reusable styles are consistently applied across the entire application, enabling
a unified and cohesive design experience.

## Features

- **Fonts:** Manages the fonts used throughout the app, defining consistent typography for headings, body text, and other text elements.
- **Themes:** Configures global themes, including light and dark modes, and handles the app's color schemes.
- **Reusable Styles:** Provides shared styles, such as button styles, animation, and other UI elements to maintain design consistency across the app.
