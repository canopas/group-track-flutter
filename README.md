## Overview
Welcome to GroupTrack, an open-source Flutter application designed to enhance family safety üë´ through real-time location sharing üìç and communication features üí¨. GroupTrack aims to provide peace of mind by ensuring the safety üõ£ of your loved ones while facilitating seamless communication regardless of their location.

### Google Maps SDK
To enable the MapView functionality, obtaining an API key as instructed in the [documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/get-api-key) is required. This key should then be included in the local.properties for android and Info.plist for ios file as follows:

Android:
```
MAPS_API_KEY=your_map_api_key
```

IOS:
```
<key>ApiMapKey</key>
<string>your_map_api_key</string>
```
Note: Set iOS minimum deployment target to 14.0 or higher

### Add config.dart
Inside the `data/lib` directory, create a new file named `config.dart`. This file will store your place API key, follow format:
```
class AppConfig {
  static const String placeApiKey = 'YOUR PLACE API KEY';
}
```

### Firebase Setup
To enable Firebase services, you will need to create a new project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
Use the `applicationId` value specified in the `app/build.gradle` file of the app as the Android package name.
Once the project is created, you will need to add the `google-services.json` file to the `android/app` module for android and `ios/Runner` module for IOS.
For more information, refer to the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=android).
